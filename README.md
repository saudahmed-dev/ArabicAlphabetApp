# ArabicAlphabetApp
Android Studio Application for learning the Arabic Alphabet 

This is a side project I am working on to help teach the (classic) Arabic Alphabet. The arabic alphabet is comprised of complex sounds 
that typically are not present in many other languages. In addition to this complexity there are many pronunciations that are
not completely correct and can make it even more difficult for one to learn the alphabet. My goal is to develop this app into
a one stop for learning the basics of arabic grammer.

Version 0.0.2
November 24th 2018

- First working prototype uploaded. All sounds functional and UI running smoothly on API 21.

Short term goals:
1. Test app on other devices.
2. Improve UI to be easier on the eyes.
3. Color code letters that share similar characteristics
